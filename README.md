# Dissociating-Role-of-Feedback-in-Voice-Motor-Control
## Author: Dante Smith (djsmith@bu.edu)

This repo is a collection of scripts used to run experiments studying speech motor control compensations in response to perturbations of somatosensory and auditory feedback.

This repo includes scripts for:
* Presentation of stimuli
* Data collection
* Data analysis
* Data visualization
* Calibration/Troubleshooting Equipment

All collected data for experiments conducted by the Guenther Speech Lab are presently hosted on BU's Shared Computing Cluster (SCC) located at *scc1.bu.edu/projectnb/busplab/Experiments/Dissociating-Role-of-Feedback-in-Voice-Motor-Control*

To run most of the scripts in this repo it is required that you also check out and include another repo in your workflow. This repo is my collection of useful MATLAB toolboxes which I keep organized for portability and version control.
